    <h2>Week 2 Reflection</h2>

    <p><strong>1. How did you approach mobile-first design?</strong><br>
    I started with a simple one-column layout for small screens, making sure text and buttons were easy to read. Then I added media queries so the design could change for tablets and desktops. This way the site looks good on any device and is easy to use.</p>

    <p><strong>2. What was the most useful HTML or CSS concept you applied this week?</strong><br>
    Flexbox was the most useful because it helped me place items neatly and keep them responsive. I also learned how to use margins and padding better to give space between elements. These small changes made the page look cleaner and more professional.</p>

    <p><strong>3. What part of HTML or CSS did you find most challenging or confusing?</strong><br>
    Media queries were the hardest part because sometimes I was not sure which style was active. I had to test my site on different screen sizes to understand how the rules worked. It was confusing at first, but I am slowly learning how to control the layout better.</p>
